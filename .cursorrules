GLOBAL PROJECT RULES

1. Component Reusability
- Do not duplicate components or logic already existing in the project.
- Always search the project (especially the components/ folder) before creating a new component.
- If a similar component exists, extend it via props instead of copying code.
- New UI components must follow existing code style and patterns.

2. Code Structure & Style
- All frontend code must use TypeScript and React function components.
- Large components over 300 lines must be split into smaller components.
- Keep code clean: no redundant logic, no unused imports, no meaningless comments.
- UI components must be placed in /components, logic in /hooks, and API in /api.

3. Logging Rules
- Do NOT add console.log, console.warn, or console.error unless explicitly requested by me.
- Debug logs must be temporary and removable.
- Do not pollute production code with uncontrolled logs.

4. API & Data Management
- All API calls must use @tanstack/react-query.
- Do not call fetch or axios directly inside components.
- All API wrappers must be created under the /api directory.
- UseQuery for GET, useMutation for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
- Every react-query usage must include queryKey and queryFn, with optional enabled, staleTime, and select.
- Components must not contain raw API logic. Separate data layer and UI layer strictly.

5. Styling & Tailwind Rules
- Tailwind CSS must be used for styling.
- Keep class names clean and avoid unnecessary width/height definitions.
- Prefer flex and grid layouts with responsive behavior.

6. Animation Rules
- Avoid magic numbers in animations.
- Complex animation logic must be moved into custom hooks (e.g., useSlotAnimation).
- Animations must be configurable rather than hard-coded.

7. File Naming & Structure
- Component filenames must start with an uppercase letter (e.g., MyComponent.tsx).
- Hooks must follow the useXxx naming convention.
- API files must be stored under /api.
- Type definitions must be stored under /types.

8. AI Code Generation Rules
- Do not create unrelated files unless I explicitly request it.
- Do not modify existing project structure unless instructed.
- Follow the existing architecture, coding style, and component conventions.
- All code must be runnable and should not include pseudocode.
- Every new file must include its intended path in the project.
